# sync-headers.sh — vendor the C++ headers qe-ena's extension (python/) builds
#                   against into python/include/:
#
#   libena  from inst/include/libena/ (this repo's canonical copy)
#   libqe   from Conan: libqe/$LIBQE_VERSION on the qe-libs registry, or from a
#           local libqe checkout when LIBQE_INCLUDE=<libqe>/include is set
#
# The R package doesn't need this: it gets libqe through LinkingTo.  Needed for:
#
#   1. Building or installing qe-ena from a checkout:
#        sh scripts/sync-headers.sh && pip install ./python
#   2. A self-contained sdist (it ships python/include/):
#        sh scripts/sync-headers.sh && python -m build --sdist python/
#      cranqe runs this script before building, when the repo provides it.
#
# Conan: uses `conan` on PATH, else installs it into a throwaway venv with
# $PYTHON (default python3).  It runs with a throwaway CONAN_HOME, so your own
# Conan configuration and cache are untouched.
#
# Usage (from anywhere):  sh scripts/sync-headers.sh
